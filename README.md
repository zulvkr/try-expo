# Project Name

## Description

This project is an Expo application that serves as a template for building React Native applications. It includes the integration of Mirage JS for mocking API responses, React Query with Axios for data fetching and management, and React Hook Form for form handling.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash

## Running the Development Server

To run the Expo development server, use the following command:
